## Features:
- **theming** Custom colors with css variables.
- **Responsive** Unpredictive layout thanks to CSS grid :)
- **Modular** each square is a module that you can move / remove / customize

## Built with
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) Pug is a template engine for Node and for the browser. It compiles to HTML and has a simplified syntax.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, you will need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)- Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime that will help running javascript code   outside your browser

## Installation
1. Once nodeJs is installed, install Parcel globally on your machine.
    ```sh
    npm install -g parcel-bundler
    ```
2. Paste this command in your terminal to clone the repository inside the folder of your choice 
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:kikiklang/pomme-page.git
    ```
3. Still in your terminal, move into pomme-page freshly created folder and run this command to install all project dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. To finish the installation, you will have to provide a `.env` file where you can place your configuration variables like API keys. Put this file at the root of pomme-page folder (see example with the `.env.example` file).

## Usage
 You can now open the project in your IDE and run this project locally
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

  To bundle your code - ready to ship, cleaned and lightweight
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

  To test your production build locally
  ```sh
  npm run serve
  ```

  To delete development, build and cache folders
  ```sh
  npm run clean
  ```

  To prettify and fix your code
  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```

## Modules
Pomme Page use modules to display informations: 
- **myrtille** a big link with a nice icon of your favorite site
- **raisin** a group of categorised links
- **clock** time & date
- **search** use duckduckgo or google search engines
- **binance** past and current crypto currencies data
- **openweather** current weather (needs API key: [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/unsplash)) 
- **unsplash** random image display (needs API key: [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers))
- **stormglass** sea condition (needs API key: [stormglass](https://stormglass.io/)) [free up to 50 requests per day]

## Customization

### Modules Layout and display
Layout is made with CSS grid, you can simply move modules around in `src/index.pug` file. To remove a module, you have to delete the corresponding folder in src and then remove all imports found in the 3 index files (pug, css, js).

### Myrtille
Links images work in svg format. To add a link, go to `src/index.pug` and make a myrtille. It's a pug function that takes 3 parameters:
- domain
- svg viewBox
- svg path

### Raisin
It's also a pug function with two parameters that you can put in `src/index.pug`. You must provide a name and an object of data. This object is declared in `src/raisin/raisin.pug`

### Colors
You can make your theme with the css variables found in `index.css`

## Contribution
Please feel free to contribute if you like this project and have some time to spare.

## Deploying
After the build process, you'll find a `dist` folder that parcel just created. We still have API Keys in the code. In my case, i deploy this behind a caddy reverse proxy and limit/filter access to these static files only from my personal computer IP. At the end, you will load around 45 Kilobytes of html/css/js (15 Kilobytes gzipped) in your browser, which is quite light for a startpage i suppose.

### Docker
If you don't want to set up a fully functional web server on your system, there's a docker container for that. First, build the image using the provided Dockerfile.
```sh
cd docker
docker build . -t pomme-page
```

Go on by configuring pomme-page as you would by editing the files in the `src/` directory. Don't forget to enter your API keys to `.env` or to remove unused modules. Then, run the container, but make sure to map `src/` and `.env` so your edited configuration gets deployed.
```sh
docker run -dp 80:80 -v <absolute path to your pomme-page repository>/.env:/usr/share/pomme-page/.env -v <absolute path to your pomme-page repository>/src/:/usr/share/pomme-page/src/ pomme-page
```

If you want to secure your API keys against unwanted access, you can set a valid IP(range) via the environment variable `$IPRANGE`.
```sh
docker run -dp 80:80 -v <absolute path to your pomme-page repository>/src/:/usr/share/pomme-page/src/ -e "IPRANGE=192.168.178.1/24" pomme-page
```

This way, pomme-page will be available from the IPs `192.168.178.[1-255]`

### Docker-Compose
If you'd rather use docker-compose instead of defining the necessary volumes, ports and variables from the CLI, there's a default docker-compose file as well. Just let it build the image and start a container afterwards.

```sh
cd docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
